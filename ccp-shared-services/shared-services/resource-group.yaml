# These variables apply to all the terragrunt commands at the resource group level. They are automatically pulled in using yamldecode and merged into
# the inputs of the root terragrunt.hcl file.
# Note that this file cannot be completely empty because terragrunt's yamldecode function expects an
# object, and it doesn't treat empty files as an empty object (you get a syntax error).
